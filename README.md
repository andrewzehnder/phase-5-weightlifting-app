There are global lifts and workouts that you can use to create your customized program!

If you want to add your own, you can add lifts and workouts.

After you've created your own program, and linked your workouts and lifts (through workouts), your home page will bring in each day's workout.

Fill in your completed sets, reps, and weight to save this information. The next time the lift appears, whether in the same or a different workout, you will be able to use this for reference. Your one rep max will be calculated and replaced if you increase this value!
