Phase 5 Project - Weightlifting App

## Description

This single page application was created to display and allow for adding/editing/removing programs to track your workouts! There are global lifts and workouts that can be created and/or used to add to your program. When creating your workouts, the lifts need to already be created. Once you have your workouts created, you can link them together through a program. This app is set up to have 1 program and 1 workout per day. If you need to add more, edit the program or workout to add more lifts.

## Installation

GitHub Repo: https://github.com/andrewzehnder/phase-5-weightlifting-app

To get this page running, you will need to get the front end running with "bundle install", "npm install --prefix client" then "npm start --prefix client" and start the backend with "rails setup" then "rails s" to start the server.

## Usage

There are global lifts and workouts that you can use to create your customized program!

If you want to add your own, you can add lifts and workouts.

After you've created your own program, and linked your workouts and lifts (through workouts), your home page will bring in each day's workout.

Fill in your completed sets, reps, and weight to save this information. The next time the lift appears, whether in the same or a different workout, you will be able to use this for reference. Your one rep max will be calculated and replaced if you increase this value!
